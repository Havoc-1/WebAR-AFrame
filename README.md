# Web-based Augmented Reality

Using the A-Frame web framework and AR.js library to build augmented reality scenes while using a 'HIRO' and custom marker for course work. 

5 unique AR scenes were created: 

Default marker: 
- Name rendered as an AR object
- Name on top of a blue sphere 
- Pink sphere with pulsating animation 
- Image of the Earth UV wrapped on a sphere 
- Custom made 3D model (obj) rendered as an AR object 

Custom Pattern and Marker:
- Named displayed as an AR object
